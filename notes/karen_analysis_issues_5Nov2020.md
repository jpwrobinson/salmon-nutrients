On those differences in values for sardines and anchovy: I understand the UK Dept for Health data are for the nutritional values of the most likely way in which each species would end up on our plates, exactly because there can be quite a change depending on cooking / preserving / processing method. So we prioritised those data in the Feedback report, if they were available.

 

- **Edible portions**

Great to see the data you pulled together, Grace. The [Fry paper](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fiopscience.iop.org%2Farticle%2F10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Faaa273%2Fmeta&data=04|01|james.robinson%40lancaster.ac.uk|654043ba2eb048db138708d8816f9f5c|9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a|0|1|637401663703471007|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|2000&sdata=eCn7rnAqIbHmwXGHnSIdsm2vK%2FCK6jaYG%2Fx7sZnxqqE%3D&reserved=0) also has data on carp and salmon (might be worth checking if their sources have data for the other species of interest to us too). In any case, Fry et al have quite a difference in edible portion for salmon compared to carp, driving better protein and calory retention in salmon compared to carp.

 

Here, for me, the question arises whether the higher edible portion in salmon is due to more advanced market for trimmings etc and related processing infrastructure (given high value of salmon), and is this technically possible for carp too? I understand from Nature food [omega-3 paper author Helena Hamilton](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-019-0006-0&data=04|01|james.robinson%40lancaster.ac.uk|654043ba2eb048db138708d8816f9f5c|9c9bcd11977a4e9ca9a0bc734090164a|0|1|637401663703480999|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|2000&sdata=sFqxKbbdT1HkjWgHB7Ka4ZMaTWAvZSohG4JgEbZ7uoU%3D&reserved=0) that one of the challenges in China is that the culture is to buy fish whole, and I wonder if home filleting drives lower edible portions, or is it the opposite? I’ve also just noticed that this paper mentions Omega-3 retention percentages for salmon.

 

- **Carp**

On the carp aquaculture marine ingredient input and yields, I keep coming back to the need to speak to someone who better understands the range of carp farming systems, from completely unfed to fully fed, and all sorts of semi-intensive options in between. Does anyone know who we could ask?  I noticed that the Fry paper calculated the carp protein and calory retention on the basis of fully intensive fed systems only, which combined with lower edible portions means carp doesn’t do very well compared to salmon.

 

If we can’t find more information, the top-down approach on fed carp to yield (see bottom of p. 6 in google doc) still makes sense to me. The data here could be used to have a first attempt at doing the model for carp, James, but it would be good to discuss this when we next speak.

 

- **Figure 1, UK and globally**

Figure 1 Fish oil in, salmon produced: Looking forward to seeing this, and talk through how this sits alongside the global data I put together in the spreadsheet, which also takes the fish oil used in salmon production as starting point. I will try to clean up the spreadsheet.

 

I also still have on my to-do list the question of the Scottish economy and local jobs, but please let me know if there are other things you are waiting for from me.

 

Many thanks,
