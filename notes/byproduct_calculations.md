- First of all I wanted to emphasize that we have been looking at the volume of fish oil made from by-products (not fishmeal) as this is the determining factor for the nutrient/omega 3 retention approach, and this is the limiting ingredient in salmon feed

We only had the earlier figure at the time of publishing our report

- The Mowi figure came directly from them; we could ask again, but possibly you might get a better response.
- Since doing our report I’ve also learned that the EU average (see attached EUMOFA report p. 29) is much higher is because all oil from salmon by-products is used in farming of seabream and other non-salmon species. Not sure if it might be worth approaching EUMOFA for a breakdown of their data?

The lead author is with Biomar and she has been helpful, not sure if you have any suggestions for me to ask for any background data to this that will help us?

Any thoughts, please let me know.
